# Milestone2
## What I've done
### 1.I use 28 datasets to training all the model offered by MLSeq, and use 12 dataset to test the model.
### 2.I find out the best model I have now is "voomNSC", which has about 75% accuracy.
### 3.The possible biomarkers I found is  
## What issues I found
### 1.I found in the vignette is the "voomDLDA" method, which has errors for now I can't solve, so I just skip this method.
### 2.Another thing is the model accuracy is low, maybe I need more dataset.
### 3.I need to convert the ensembl_ID into gene_name 
## What should I do next
### 1.Clear up my R Markdown
### 2.Make a table of classfication results for breast tumor data
### 2.Download more datasets to make the the best method gain more accuracy

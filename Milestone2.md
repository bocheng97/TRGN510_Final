# Milestone2
## What I've done
### 1.I use 28 datasets to training all the model offered by MLSeq, and use 12 dataset to test the model.
### 2.I find out the best model I have now is "svmRadial", which has about 60% accuracy.
### 3.The possible biomarkers I found is "ENSG00000108821.12" "ENSG00000111341.8"  "ENSG00000198888.2"  "ENSG00000160862.11" "ENSG00000070756.12" "ENSG00000161016.14".
## What issues I found
### 1.I found in the vignette is the "voomDLDA" method, which has errors for now I can't solve, so I just skip this method.
### 2.Another thing is the model accuracy is so low, I will try to improve it. Another vignette also use the same package, so I will try to find some way to improve it.

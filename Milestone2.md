# Milestone2
### I use 28 datasets to training all the model offered by MLSeq, and use 12 dataset to test the model.
### I find out the best model I have now is "svmRadial", which has about 60% accuracy.
### The possible biomarkers I found is "ENSG00000108821.12" "ENSG00000111341.8"  "ENSG00000198888.2"  "ENSG00000160862.11" "ENSG00000070756.12" "ENSG00000161016.14".

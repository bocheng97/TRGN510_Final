## Title
### Reproducing "Machine learning for RNA sequencing-based intrinsic subtyping of breast cancer."        
## Author
### Bo Cheng
## Overview 
### 1. In this project, I will try to reproduce a machine learning process from an open-access paper, "Machine learning for RNA sequencing-based intrinsic subtyping of breast cancer". 
### 2.This project is trying to improve PAM50, taking advantage of PAM50, and trying to make it adapt to RNA-seq.
### 3.The main goal of this project is to have a taste of machine learning in R. So I may do many copy and paste, but I will give my understanding and opinions in the R notebook.
### 4.The original Vignettes link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70832-2#Sec14
## Data availability
### All data are available from https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/BC_Intrinsic_subtyping.
### Some training set data are from TGCA.
## Milestone1
### Complating "the Emulation Path" coding part;
* Complating the coding part.
* complating the construction of the clasifaction of breast cancer.

### Testing the coding part;
## Milestone2
### Complating "the Machine Learning Path" coding part;
### Testing the coding part with the GSE96058 data set(training set).
## Before handing in
### Using the model to do the evaluation. 
## Deliverable
### I will use R MarkDown/Notebook/Jupyter to display a understandable codes.

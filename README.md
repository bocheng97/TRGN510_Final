# Project outlines
## Reproducing "Machine learning for RNA sequencing-based intrinsic subtyping of breast cancer."        --Bo Cheng
## Overview 
### 1. In this project, I will try to reproduce a machine learning process from an open-access paper, "Machine learning for RNA sequencing-based intrinsic subtyping of breast cancer". 
### 2.This project is trying to improve PAM50, taking advantage of PAM50, and trying to make it adaptive with RNA-seq.
### 3.The main goal of this project is to have a taste of machine learning in R.
## Data availability
### All data are available from https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/BC_Intrinsic_subtyping.
## Milestone1
### Complating "the Emulation Path" coding part;
### Testing the coding part;
## Milestone2
### Complating "the Machine Learning Path" coding part;
### Testing the coding part with the GSE96058 data set(training set)
## Milestone3
### Using the model to do the evaluation.
